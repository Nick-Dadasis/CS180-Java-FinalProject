CarlosCars - Final Project for Programming Fundamentals (CS180)
=======================================================

Overview
--------

CarlosCars is a simple car dealership management system created as the final project for my Programming Fundamentals class. The program simulates a basic car dealership where users can browse, purchase, and lease cars from a predefined inventory. The system reads and writes data to a file to manage the inventory of cars.

Key Concepts
------------

-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulates car attributes and methods in a `Car` class, demonstrating the use of constructors, getters, setters, and method overloading.
-   **File Handling**: Uses Java's `File` and `Scanner` classes to read car data from a file and `PrintWriter` to update the inventory file after transactions.
-   **Control Structures**: Utilizes loops, conditional statements, and a switch-case structure for user interaction and program flow.
-   **User Input and Output**: Interacts with users through the console, allowing them to choose actions like purchasing or leasing a car.

Features
--------

-   **View Cars**: Browse available cars from the inventory file.
-   **Purchase Cars**: Buy a car and update its availability.
-   **Lease Cars**: Lease a car using different packages with custom monthly payments.
-   **Backup Inventory**: Automatically updates and saves the car inventory after each transaction.

How to Run
----------

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Compile the Java files.
3.  Make sure the `CarlosCars.txt` file is in the same directory as the compiled program.
4.  Run the program and follow the on-screen prompts to browse, purchase, or lease cars.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

This project demonstrates key programming fundamentals, including:

-   Working with classes and objects.
-   Managing file input and output in Java.
-   Implementing control structures and loops for decision-making.
-   Handling user input through the console.
